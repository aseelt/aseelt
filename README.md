Hello!

I'm currently at TechElevator in Pittsburgh, a full stack coding bootcamp. I'm switching careers and am looking forward to my next challenge. My class is focused on C#/.NET; we are also covering SQL, web APIs, and the front end.

I have one project that I am ready to share in this repository. Game of the Generals is based on the Filipino board game - it's a mix of Chess, Guess Who, and Rock, Paper, Scissors, with an element of fog of war thrown in. It's at an early stage but is playable.

I've also included my Lego - What Can I Build application. It's still in an early stage - the databases are built and can call an external API and the UI can display a randomized Lego set and its parts.

Thank you for visiting!
