3rd:		User level controllers - view how many sets they have, how many parts in the sets - accesses sql daos for just two tables - USERSETS and SETPARTS
2nd:		Admin and Login controllers: LOGIN, USER (permissions, activation), FILL (calls API service to fill), VIEW - my stuff to get the thing working. 
			Only login visible to non-admins
			Only USER, FILL visible to me
			FILL calls the api service, adds to the database - ADDS using SQL DAO, check if it exists, UPDATES using SQL DAO, DELETE
				CONVERT TO ARRAY
				ONLY USE THE ALL - want the whole database, but go through one by one
				Check for updates in the database here
			VIEW is just to read - reads using SQL dao
1st: 		Api service to rebrickable gets info DONE
Ground:		mysql database DONE

	Why? 
End goal is to get the number of parts a user has in all their sets
	Get it by colour specific
	Get it by colour NOT specific
